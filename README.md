## Hi there 👋

- 🧑‍💼 I’m Kenneth Calhoun.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on enhancing SaaS platforms with real-time dashboards, AI integrations using OpenAI, and modernizing legacy Laravel/Vue.js applications.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about advanced prompt engineering, AI-driven UX design patterns, and serverless deployment strategies for scalable SaaS solutions.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on SaaS tools, dashboard interfaces, and full-stack applications that need a seamless bridge between powerful Laravel backends and modern Vue/React frontends.  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with optimizing frontend performance for large data sets and integrating cutting-edge AI features into existing app ecosystems.  
- 💬 Ask me about Laravel + Inertia.js, building multi-tenant SaaS architectures, custom analytics dashboards, or crafting clean UI with Vue or React.
